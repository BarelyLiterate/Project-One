Views on: “Artistic liberty” ie making  up, or embellishing stories , that have to be plausable but arn’t factually correct.

Which...Person?
1) “We At Dark”
2) “I joined Dark”
3) (me – And honestly where I’m itching to write it from, because the 1st sentence is not BS.

Embellishment(s);
on a scale of 1/5 – 5 being EMBELLISH AWAY
1 being “yikes, nah don’t do that”

1) 4/5 (Can be scaled back a bit) Dark is focused on security, so I went behind their back and asked a white-hat-type friend to look for vulnerabilities
2) 5/5 Vulnerabilities WERE found. Not anywhere financially oriented, personal data based, just some communication with the mirror server that should be blocked.

3)Bug Bounty… If only there was a bounty on implementing bug bounties.. I’d be rich! 
See This * page for information on how to disclose bugs. We also wanted to be quite upfront about our reward scheme. NO vendorships will be awarded – As we see this as abusing our power. Bug hunters don’t necessarily make good vendors.
