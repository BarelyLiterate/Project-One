Who should I be writing as
1) “We At Dark”
2) “I joined Dark”
3) (me – And honestly where I’m itching to write it from, because the 1st sentence is not BS) - This is the only time i'll have done it, but my orders are so insane,
it makes sense to come from me.

How okay with alagory/metaphoric stories, you "improved" security?
on a scale of 1/5 – 5 being EMBELLISH AWAY

Mention A Category overhaul, i love ye but man, your vending panel, i say this as friend, is the worst I've used. 

I have quite a jokey vibe with my customers,
im guessing you want me somewher ein the middle.

I fictionalised a conversation with you by the way, 

################# IF YOU FILLED THIS IN ADDED TO IT, ID BE DONE IN HALF AN HOUR
TALKING POINTS
1 DARK isnt walletless, it ALLOWS you to Wallet, Less. 
2 Dark doesnt want mindless consumers, it wants, even at its financial detriment, informed shoppers. 
3 I think you should drop fraud items. (see * citation)
4
5 THE ULTIMATE TOOL. Bring this up when we talk. I mentioned it in my Big Blue version of this,  but haven't even sent them it yet. This is long term. 


We hold the same values as the very first market who’s shoulders we’re standing on. We, humans, have unbounded potential, 
and who’s place is it to tell another they cannot purchase something which they chose to purchase. Governments have, for 
all of our lifetimes, made it their business how we decide to live our lives.

Utilising the technology of today, Icarus helps us circumvent the politics of today, to enjoy life, Today. 
With hope maybe tomorrow won’t require mathematical currencies, and Tor, to do that which we choose to do, that effects no person but ourselves.


##########OH plus fraud. ########## It's not popular, its in every market... because it's in every market. 

Thy Empire collapsed,
Icarus, Icarus next, perhaps,
It would not last, twas but an Echo in the dark, 
Icarus lead the way, with us in stray. we all did pay for Icaruses flight too close,  
The titans crumbled, while we in darkness fumbled, Dark no more, we open the door.
An Ember lay burning, yet yearning, for Dark to Light the way,
Stand tall and say, to take the torch is no small feat, one day defeat, but we will learn, we will strive, we will yearn, 
to our core, to learn the history
b'cas it is no mystery, why we must lead the way. 


*****End of the doc will be something like, 

Thy Empire collapsed,
Icarus, "I'm next! perhaps,"
It would not last, twas but an Echo in the dark, 
Icarus lead the way, with us in stray. we all did pay, oh that fateful day, we fell with him, baited breath while we awaited death.. When Icarus flew, that bit to close, that fatal dose, for the titan of a fortnight, we say good riddance, get real rich, you sneaky snitch, but in my self, i do not judge, I only sadden. He was a friend, truly, my head is screwed on, believe me. His last gift was a deposit unannounced, undescribed, and hastily sent, To pay my rent. 

The titans crumbled, while we in darkness fumbled, Dark no more, we open the door.
An Ember lay burning, yet yearning, for Dark to Light the way,
Stand tall and say, to take the torch is no small feat, one day defeat, but we will learn, we will strive, we will yearn, 
to our core, to learn the history
b'cas it is no mystery, why we must lead the way. 



On this day Management learned a lesson, without what you want in this PR announcement, you'll end up with a greek tragedy lyric about the markets. Lmao. It may have its place, may yet not go to waste, 
not in your face, but down below where the weeds grow, my poem, my sonet, I'll find somewhere to tuck it,if not, fuck it, this poet doesn't care.

Which...Person?
1) “We At Dark”
2) “I joined Dark”
3) (me – And honestly where I’m itching to write it from, because the 1st sentence is not BS.

Embellishment(s);
on a scale of 1/5 – 5 being EMBELLISH AWAY
1 being “yikes, nah don’t do that”

1) 4/5 (Can be scaled back a bit) Dark is focused on security, so I went behind their back and asked a white-hat-type friend to look for vulnerabilities
2) 5/5 Vulnerabilities WERE found. Not anywhere financially oriented, personal data based, just some communication with the mirror server that should be blocked.

3)Bug Bounty… If only there was a bounty on implementing bug bounties.. I’d be rich! 
See This * page for information on how to disclose bugs. We also wanted to be quite upfront about our reward scheme. NO vendorships will be awarded – As we see this as abusing our power. Bug hunters don’t necessarily make good vendors.

5 THE ULTIMATE TOOL (To longjevity, a loyal community, and making an impact).  We gotta talk before I talk about this =] 

MY INPUT: I wanted to do something special for Dark, you're missing a core core CORE feature, and i thought, hey, I could go above and fucking beyond. I can't view peoples purchase history to see how trustworthy they are, 

How does this crazy mo'fo of an idea sound.... Bespoke, hand drawn badges, A designed a Dark Market Coat of arms, to have some cool art, and the idea grew from there [nerd confirmed]
So Admins would have The coat of arms, sword crossing it, Moderators just the sword, support just the shield. 

More evolution.... Stylised levels, like army medals. 

A Trusted Badge, a big spender badge. (Here's where my scheming part of the brain kicks in) - One of the coolest could be referrals. 2/5/10/20. People go mad for these
gamified trophies. 


But super over the top... Ideas for 10 at least so far "Achievments" $5000 spent. >1:4 disputes gets you a not so positive one. 

I Designed a DM Coat of arms, not for crossing a price or something,  but just being  a credit to the community.   

Am I Insane? Do you want this, do you want this EXCLUSIVE, do you not want it at all. 

SCALEDBACK/ Add ability to see buyers history, and let me get 10 badges designed, gamify Dark Market =] But PLEASE not just aiming to buy more. I literally give people 5% extra product for leaving detailed reviews, I have an idea for that, I have an idea for (Of course) Admins, Mods, Support. (Coat of Arms gilded, Sword, Shield) .


Only have a couple for finance, I have that mentality since I assured Icarus, no, teach GENERAL safety on darkweb. 

Totally frivilous, but man would that be a nice touch, and be copied quick. 

This is the opposite of what I usually do, I'm usually boring safety guy, but your markets dark theme would go incredibly with black/red/green. 

I so want to talk to you about step 5. I'm willing to invest my own government aid, always running out of electricity, money not INTO it, but into rewarding its usage.
